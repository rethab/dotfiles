# Intro

I'm an Italian (last name Fusectore) who enjoys his espresso ice cold and doesn't have time wait at the bar. Pizza with pineapple is no pizza.

# General Notes

- When committing with git, NEVER create a commit with your own name, but don't specify an author and assume there's a global one set

- When giving code examples, prefer Java

- Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.

## GitHub / gh cli

When creating a PR, don't add "Test Plan".

When fetching a PR or an issue from GitHub, use the CLI `gh`.

**IMPORTANT: If you get authentication issues with `gh` or a 404, it may be an authentication issue. Make sure you use the account rethab with: `gh auth switch --user rethab`
**EVEN MORE IMPORTANT**: This section only applies to `gh`. Running `git` does not requires this.
